~~[Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/21759) IP of node peers, [`req.ips; app.set('trust proxy', true)`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10849687/express-js-how-to-get-remote-client-address) remote referer~~ [local](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/21759):  [`enode.Node`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17643) and [`admin.nodeInfo.enode.LocalNode`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17753)

>~~Geth explicitly excludes internal IP addresses from it's discovery to avoid publishing unreachable nodes into the DHT. *Is [this](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2765) not faulty security?* eth.accounts lists the accounts that are locally available on this node. They are not synced between nodes. With eth.getBalance you can query the balance of any account (not necessarily a local one).~~ [New API](https://github.com/cryptomental/go-ethereum/commit/f3d1cfb543bb21d56032d62e5ccfc40c5763454e) is added to retrieve the `enode.Node` instance of a peer. The behavior of `Server.Self` with `discovery` disabled is improved. It now tries much harder to report a working IP address, falling back to `127.0.0.1` if no suitable address can be determined through other means. *These changes were needed for tests of other packages later in the series.*
